### Integration

The chatbot is integrated into the `EventDetails.jsx` page and appears as a floating action button in the bottom-right corner.

## Usage

1. **Open Chat**: Click the blue chat icon in the bottom-right corner of any event details page
2. **Ask Questions**: Type questions about the meeting, company, or person
3. **View Sources**: Click on source chips to visit referenced websites
4. **Close Chat**: Click the X button in the chat header

## Example Questions

- "What is the company's latest funding round?"
- "Tell me more about [Person Name]'s background"
- "What are the company's main competitors?"
- "Any recent news about this company?"
- "What should I know before this meeting?"

## System Prompt

The chatbot uses a specialized system prompt that:

- Identifies itself as a meeting preparation assistant
- Provides context about the current meeting
- Includes recent web search results when available
- Encourages professional, helpful responses
- Advises honesty when information is unavailable

## API Keys Required

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: For GPT-4o mini model
- `TAVILY_API_KEY`: For web search functionality

Both APIs are the same ones used by the existing report generation system.
